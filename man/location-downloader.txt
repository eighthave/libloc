== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
`location-downloader update`

== DESCRIPTION
The `location-downloader` command updates the local version of the
location database.

== OPTIONS

	The path of the database which is being updated.
	+
	If this option is omitted, the system's database will be opened.

--quiet::
	Enable quiet mode

--debug::
	Enable debugging mode

== COMMANDS

'update'::
	This command will try to update the local database.
	+
	It will terminate with a return code of zero if the database has been
	successfully updated. 1 on error, 2 on invalid call and 3 if the
	database was already the latest version.

'verify'::
	Verifies the downloaded database.

'--help'::
	Shows a short help text on using this program.

'--version'::
	Shows the program's version and exists.

== EXIT CODES
The 'location-downloader' command will normally exit with code zero.
If there has been a problem and the requested action could not be performed,
the exit code is unequal to zero.

== HOW IT WORKS
The downloader checks a DNS record for the latest version of the database.
It will then try to download a file with that version from a mirror server.
If the downloaded file is outdated, the next mirror will be tried until we
have found a file that is recent enough.
