== NAME
location - Query the location database

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
`location lookup ADDRESS [ADDRESS...]`
`location get-as ASN [ASN...]`
`location search-as STRING`
`location update`
`location verify`
`location list-networks-by-as ASN`
`location list-networks-by-cc COUNTRY_CODE`
`location list-networks-by-flags [--anonymous-proxy|--satellite-provider|--anycast]`

== DESCRIPTION
`location` retrieves information from the location database.
This data can be used to determine someone's location on the Internet
and for building firewall rulesets to block access from certain ASes
or countries.

== OPTIONS

--database FILE::
-d FILE::
	The path of the database which is being opened.
	+
	If this option is omitted, the system's database will be opened.

--quiet::
	Enable quiet mode

--debug::
	Enable debugging mode

== COMMANDS

'lookup ADDRESS [ADDRESS...]'::
		This command returns the network the given IP address has been found in
		as well as its Autonomous System if that information is available.

'get-as ASN [ASN...]'::
	This command returns the name of the owning organisation of the Autonomous
	System.

'search-as STRING'::
	Lists all Autonomous Systems which match the given string.
	+
	The search will be performed case-insensitively.

'update'::
	This command will try to update the local database.
	+
	It will terminate with a return code of zero if the database has been
	successfully updated. 1 on error, 2 on invalid call and 3 if the
	database was already the latest version.

'verify'::
	Verifies the downloaded database.

'list-networks-by-as [--family=[ipv6|ipv4]] [--output-format FORMAT] ASN'::
	Lists all networks which belong to this Autonomous System.
	+
	The '--family' parameter can be used to filter output to only IPv6 or
	IPv4 addresses.
	+
	The '--output-format' parameter can change the output so that it can be
	directly loaded into other software. The following options are available:
	+
	* 'list' (default): Just lists all networks, one per line
	* 'ipset': For ipset
	* 'nftables': For nftables
	* 'xt_geoip': Returns a list of networks to be loaded into the xt_geoip
	  kernel module

'list-networks-by-cc [--family=[ipv6|ipv4]] [--output-format FORMAT] COUNTRY_CODE'::
	Lists all networks that belong to a country.
	+
	The country has to be encoded in ISO3166 Alpha-2 notation.
	+
	See above for usage of the '--family' and '--output-format' parameters.

'list-networks-by-flags [--family=[ipv6|ipv4]] [--output-format FORMAT] [--anonymous-proxy|--satellite-provider|--anycast]'::
	Lists all networks that have a certain flag.
	+
	See above for usage of the '--family' and '--output-format' parameters.

'--help'::
	Shows a short help text on using this program.

'--version'::
	Shows the program's version and exists.

== EXIT CODES
The 'location' command will normally exit with code zero.
If there has been a problem and the requested action could not be performed,
the exit code is unequal to zero.

== HOW IT WORKS
The downloader checks a DNS record for the latest version of the database.
It will then try to download a file with that version from a mirror server.
If the downloaded file is outdated, the next mirror will be tried until we
have found a file that is recent enough.

== BUGS
Please report all bugs to the bugtracker at https://bugzilla.ipfire.org/.
